2025-10-15T22:20Z | Captured new baseline backtests (run_ids 1149406114, 1370479558) and introduced cumulative performance logging in `ZacQC/main.py` to expose per-stage timings for profiling. No functional behavior changes.
2025-10-15T22:27Z | Moved risk-limit checks to algorithm-level OnData and skipped per-symbol processing when no new 15-second bar. Result: backtest runtime dropped from ~200s to ~97s (run_id 1596293644) with identical trade outputs.
2025-10-15T19:41Z | Pruned rally detector cache, optimized max drawdown metric, and defaulted verbose logging off; reran backtest (run_id 1134364430) and cut runtime to 89.44 s with strategy_logic max 25.27 ms while slashing log volume (~35k â†’ 20 lines).
2025-10-15T20:12Z | Shifted 30DMA range math into `DataManager` with rolling cache and refactored `record_performance` to use preallocated slots, dropping metrics avg to 0.05 ms and total stage avg to 0.24 ms. New run_id 1684470332 completes in 73.85 s (38k pts/s) with unchanged order hash 84e79bd641b57df60c29386afb1ecca5.
2025-10-15T20:28Z | Cached daily 15-second bars inside `ConditionsChecker` and reset cache with daily state to eliminate redundant RollingWindow scans. Latest run_id 1969908674 finishes in 65.67 s (43k pts/s), strategy_logic avg falls to 0.12 ms, and order hash remains 84e79bd641b57df60c29386afb1ecca5.
